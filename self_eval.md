# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  + Iterations as they relate to hashes. Understanding the proper keystrokes necessary to get the code to work properly.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  + I'm good at taking note, but I need to put them into flashcards or a similar type of tool that will help me with terminology and learning practices better.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  + Always try to solve it first, going back through notes or past lessons to try to glean answers or ideas. Google is my second stop, and asking for help my 3rd.
